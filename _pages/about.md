Hello, my name is Logan Hyslop, I like math.  I am a PhD student at Harvard this fall.

Some facts about me: I enjoy sailing and doing math, lately I seem to be listening to a lot of Kid Cudi, and I have ADHD.

Before this I am at UCLA, where I was unofficially advised by [Paul Balmer](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~balmer).

## Interests

I am primarily interested in homotopy theory, and its applications- in particular algebraic K-theory and trace methods.

Everyone likes the Mumford quote, “[Algebraic geometry] seems to have acquired
the reputation of being esoteric, exclusive, and very abstract, with adherents who are secretly
plotting to take over all the rest of mathematics. In one respect this last point is accurate.”     
This description I believe also applies quite aptly to homotopy theory these days, and I'd like to further the plot.



## Miscellaneous

To insert a shameless plug, [here are slides](/files/YouCouldHaveCondensedMath.pdf) from a talk I gave entitled You Could've Condensed Mathematics.  The talk was designed for undergraduates, meant to be a very non-technicaly introduction to some of the ideas of condensed math.<!--- (Note to self, eventually try to make slides for an analysis-oriented audience with more details) -->  

For a more technical introduction, [here is a video](https://researchseminars.org/talk/HomotopyTheoryAndApps/46/) of a talk I gave introducing condensed math and analytic geometry, starting from the beginning and ending with the definition of analytic spaces. (See my CV for more details and more of my talks).
